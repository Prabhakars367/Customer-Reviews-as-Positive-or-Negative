# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis Model** to classify IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.
- **Model Training**: Implements **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model for future predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of IMDB movie reviews labeled as either **positive** or **negative**. It is commonly used for sentiment classification tasks.

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Prabhakars367/Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB.git
 cd Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open `PART_B.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially.

## 📊 Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.89. Precision and recall scores provide insights into classification quality.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like **Naïve Bayes**, **SVM**, or **BERT**.
- Use **word embeddings** like Word2Vec or GloVe for better text representation.
- Handle **imbalanced data** with techniques like oversampling or class weighting.
- Tune hyperparameters to further optimize performance.
